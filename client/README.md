# Exercise Tracker :running:

I've build this proyect following [FreeCodeCamp's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M), but changing it from class based components in React to hooks, and instead of bootstrap, i've used Material-ui as React UI framework

## Tecnologies used :star2:

- MongoDb - MongoAtlas
- Express
- Node.js
- React
- Axion
- Material-UI && [Material-UI Pickers](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
